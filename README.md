## 🌨️ About

The Quantum Black Ice Detection System is a **cutting-edge real-world application** that combines meteorological data analysis, **AI/ML deep learning**, **real-time WebSocket streaming**, and **satellite radar integration** to identify dangerous black ice conditions on roads. Black ice is one of the most hazardous winter driving conditions because it's nearly invisible and forms suddenly.

### What is Black Ice?

Black ice is a thin, transparent layer of ice that forms on road surfaces, typically when:
- Temperatures hover around freezing (0°C / 32°F)
- High humidity or recent precipitation
- Clear skies at night cause radiational cooling
- Low wind speeds allow ice to form

It's called "black ice" because it's transparent and you can see the road surface through it, making it extremely dangerous for drivers.

## 🧮 Prediction Algorithm

The black ice prediction system uses a multi-factor analysis approach:

### Risk Factors

1. **Temperature** (40 points max)
   - Maximum risk at 0°C (32°F)
   - Range: -5°C to +2°C

2. **Humidity** (25 points max)
   - Higher humidity increases risk
   - Threshold: 80%+

3. **Dew Point Convergence** (20 points max)
   - Temperature near dew point
   - Indicates condensation likely

4. **Wind Speed** (15 points max)
   - Low wind allows ice formation
   - Threshold: < 3 m/s

5. **Recent Precipitation** (20 points max)
   - Provides moisture for ice
   - Recent rain/snow significantly increases risk

### Risk Levels

- **None**: 0-19% probability
- **Low**: 20-39% probability
- **Moderate**: 40-59% probability
- **High**: 60-79% probability
- **Extreme**: 80-100% probability
